Traffic lights

It is planned to install radars with cameras at traffic lights throughout the city
they notice the vehicles driving over the speed limit. For this purpose, it is necessary to store information about the license plates with the information
of the owner of the vehicle (name and surname), so that at the moment when
if the license plate of a vehicle that has exceeded the speed limit is observed, the information about the owner of the vehicle should be obtained with
complexity O(1).
Input: The number of license plates ùëÅ is given in the first line. Each of
the following ùëÅ lines contain information about the license plate and the name and
the last name of the owner of the vehicle. The maximum is given in the next row
allowed speed, and then the daily report from the radar is given in a new line, that is, a list of vehicles with license plates that were observed by the radar,
with what speed they passed and the exact time, separated by a space (the order
not chronological).

Output: The daily radar report needs to be redone, so it should
to get information about drivers who have committed an offence. The output should
be in the format: first and last name of the owners of vehicles that have exceeded
the speed limit, separated by a space and ordered by the time when
the radar spotted them.

Note: You can use one of the following classes for weather
Java: SimpleDateFormat or Date.
